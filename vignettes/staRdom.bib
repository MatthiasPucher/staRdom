	abstract = {Despite considerable research on the linkages between dissolved organic matter (DOM) and bacteria, it is not yet clear how the abundance of the main aquatic clades relates to DOM composition in natural aquatic systems. We evaluated this relation using PARAFAC modeling of excitation–emission fluorescence spectroscopy and spectroscopic indexes to characterize DOM composition, and fluorescence in situ hybridization, to quantify the major bacterial groups in a subtropical lagoon. The DOM exhibited marked temporal variations in concentration, molecular weight, aromaticity, color, degree of humification, and freshness, and proportion of the three different fluorescent components identified. All major bacterial clades (Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, and Cytophaga-Flavobacteria) were significantly linked to DOM concentration and/or composition, being those crucial factors for modeling their abundance in situ. The combination and significance of the factors was specific for each bacterial group, strongly indicating that they behave as coherent and distinctive units. Cytophaga-Flavobacteria and Betaproteobacteria were the groups which correlated with more DOM properties. Alphaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria abundances were significantly explained by low or high dissolved organic carbon concentrations, respectively. The significant relationships between DOM properties and the main bacterial groups delineated a profile of each group regarding DOM preferences/dislikes, in agreement with evidence derived from genome analysis to single-cell substrate uptake. These results highlight the specificities of the main bacterial clades, providing support for a functional classification of the bacterioplankton regarding DOM processing at the level of bacterial classes.},

	abstract = {Bacterial utilization of high-molecular-weight (HMW; {\textgreater} 1 kDa) and low-molecular-weight (LMW; {\textless}1 kDa) dissolved organic C (DOC) was investigated in freshwater and marine systems by measuring dissolved oxygen consumption, bacterial abundance, and bacterial production in size-fractionated samples. Tangential-flow ultrafiltration was used to separate HMW and LMW DOC. More than 80\% of the DOC in Amazon River samples was recovered in the HMW fraction, whereas most marine DOC (up to 70\%) was of LMW. Bacterial growth efficiencies were consistently higher in the LMW fractions (16-66\%) than in the HMW fractions (8-39\%), indicating compositional differences in the two size fractions. In all experiments, measured rates of bacterial growth and respiration in HMW incubations were higher than those in LMW incubations. Carbon-normalized bacterial DOC utilization rates were 1.4–4-fold greater in the HMW fractions than in the LMW fractions, and a greater proportion (0.7–22.5\%) of HMW DOC was utilized per day than LMW DOC (0.5–6.6\%). All bacterial growth and respiration measurements indicated that HMW DOC was utilized to a greater extent than LMW DOC in all environments investigated. The traditional model of DOM degradation, stating that LMW compounds are most bioreactive, does not appear to apply to the bulk of natural DOM. Rather, the data and results from independent studies suggest a new conceptual model whereby the bioreactivity of organic matter decreases along a continuum of size (from large to small) and diagenetic state (from fresh to old). This size-reactivity continuum model suggests that the bulk of HMW DOM is more bioreactive and less diagenetically altered than the bulk of LMW DOM.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT Because freshwater covers such a small fraction of the Earth’s surface area, inland freshwater ecosystems (particularly lakes, rivers, and reservoirs) have rarely been considered as potentially important quantitative components of the carbon cycle at either global or regional scales. By taking published estimates of gas exchange, sediment accumulation, and carbon transport for a variety of aquatic systems, we have constructed a budget for the role of inland water ecosystems in the global carbon cycle. Our analysis conservatively estimates that inland waters annually receive, from a combination of background and anthropogenically altered sources, on the order of 1.9 Pg C y−1 from the terrestrial landscape, of which about 0.2 is buried in aquatic sediments, at least 0.8 (possibly much more) is returned to the atmosphere as gas exchange while the remaining 0.9 Pg y−1 is delivered to the oceans, roughly equally as inorganic and organic carbon. Thus, roughly twice as much C enters inland aquatic systems from land as is exported from land to the sea. Over prolonged time net carbon fluxes in aquatic systems tend to be greater per unit area than in much of the surrounding land. Although their area is small, these freshwater aquatic systems can affect regional C balances. Further, the inclusion of inland, freshwater ecosystems provides useful insight about the storage, oxidation and transport of terrestrial C, and may warrant a revision of how the modern net C sink on land is described.},

An efficient approach to tracking the production and removal of specific DOM fractions is needed across disciplines, for purposes that range from improving global carbon budgets to optimizing water treatment in engineered systems. Although widely used to study DOM, fluorescence spectroscopy has yet to deliver specific fractions with known spectral properties and predictable distributions. Here, we mathematically isolate four visible-wavelength fluorescent fractions in samples from contrasting lake, river, and ocean environments. Using parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC), we show that most measured fluorescence in environmental samples can be explained by ubiquitous spectra with nearly stable optical properties and photodegradation behaviors over environmental pH gradients. Sample extraction changed bulk fluorescence spectra but not the number or shape of underlying PARAFAC components, while photobleaching preferentially removed the two longest-wavelength components. New approaches to analyzing fluorescence data sets incorporating these findings should improve the interpretation of DOM fluorescence and increase its utility for tracing organic matter biogeochemistry in aquatic systems.},

ecosystems, which is involved in a large variety of biogeochemical and
ecological processes, and recent literature suggests that it could be
strongly affected by agriculture in different climates. Based on novel
monitoring techniques, we investigated the interaction of climate and
agriculture effects on DOM quantity and quality. To examine this, we
took water samples over 2 years in two paired intensive and extensive
farming catchments in each of Denmark (temperate climate) and Uruguay
(subtropical climate). We measured dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and
nitrogen (DON) concentrations and DOC and DON molecular fractions with
size-exclusion chromatography. Moreover, we characterized DOM quality
with absorbance and fluorescence measurements, as well as parallel
factor analysis (PARAFAC). We also calculated the DOC and DON loads
based on daily discharge measurements, as well as measured precipitation
and air temperature. The fluvial DOM in the catchments in Uruguay was
characterized by higher temporal variability of DOC and DON loads which
were clearly to a higher temporal variability of precipitation and a DOM
composition with rather plant-like character relative to the Danish
catchments. Moreover, we found a consistently higher temporal
variability of DOC and DON loads in the intensive farming catchments
than in the extensive farming catchments, with highest temporal
variability in the Uruguayan intensive farming catchment. Furthermore,
the composition of DOM exported from the intensive farming catchments
was consistently complex and always related to microbial processing in
both Denmark and Uruguay. This was indicated by low C : N ratios,
several spectroscopic DOM composition indices and PARAFAC fluorescence
components. We propose that the consistent effect of intensive farming
on DOM composition and the temporal variability of DOC and DON loads is
related to similarities in the management of agriculture, which may have
widescale implications for fluvial DOM composition, as well as related
ecological processes and biogeochemical cycles.},

Due to the uniqueness of the PARAFAC model and analogy between the structure of fluorescence data and the PARAFAC model, it is apparent that PARAFAC can resolve overlapping signals into pure spectra and relative concentrations under mild conditions. There are hundreds of applications exemplifying this, but still the use of PARAFAC has not spread from chemometrics to more main-stream analytical chemistry. Many reasons can be offered to explain this, but one seems to be that in practice it is difficult for chemometric novices to make use of PARAFAC. Selection of wavelengths, handling of scatter and of outliers are all issues that must be dealt with in order to build a good PARAFAC model. In this paper, a new algorithm called EEMizer is developed that aims to automate the use of PARAFAC. Through several examples it is shown how this algorithm can provide appealing PARAFAC models of data that would otherwise be hard to model.},

It is based on scrutinizing the ‘appropriateness’ of the structural model based on the data and the estimated parameters of gradually augmented models.

Using examples from a range of different types of data, it is shown that the core consistency diagnostic is an effective tool for determining the appropriate number of components in e.g. PARAFAC models.

EEMs contain information which can be modeled using the parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) model but the data analysis is often complicated due to both Rayleigh and Raman scattering. There are several established ways to deal with scattering effects. However, all of these methods have associated problems. This paper develops a new method for handling scattering using interpolation in the areas affected by first- and second-order Rayleigh and Raman scatter in such a way that the interfering signal is, at best, removed. The suggested method is fast and requires no additional input other than specifying the scattering region. The results of the proposed method were compared with those obtained from common alternative approaches used for preprocessing fluorescence data before analysis with PARAFAC and were shown to be equally good for various types of EEM data. The main advantage of the interpolation method is in its lack of additional metaparameters, its algorithmic speed and subsequent speed-up of PARAFAC modeling. It also allows for using EEM data in software not able to handle missing data. Copyright © 2007 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

PARAFAC is a generalization of PCA to higher order arrays, but some of the characteristics of the method are quite different from the ordinary two-way case. There is no rotation problem in PARAFAC, and e.g., pure spectra can be recovered from multi-way spectral data. One cannot as in PCA estimate components successively as this will give a model with poorer fit, than if the simultaneous solution is estimated. Finally scaling and centering is not as straightforward in the multi-way case as in the two-way case. An important advantage of using multi-way methods instead of unfolding methods is that the estimated models are very simple in a mathematical sense, and therefore more robust and easier to interpret. All these aspects plus more are explained in this tutorial and an implementation in Matlab code is available, that contains most of the features explained in the text. Three examples show how PARAFAC can be used for specific problems. The applications include subjects as: Analysis of variance by PARAFAC, a five-way application of PARAFAC, PARAFAC with half the elements missing, PARAFAC constrained to positive solutions and PARAFAC for regression as in principal component regression.},

	abstract = {In this paper the purpose and use of centering and scaling are discussed in depth. The main focus is on two-way bilinear data analysis, but the results can easily be generalized to multiway data analysis. In fact, one of the scopes of this paper is to show that if two-way centering and scaling are understood, then multiway centering and scaling is quite straightforward. In the literature it is often stated that preprocessing of multiway arrays is difficult, but here it is shown that most of the difficulties do not pertain to three- and higher-way modeling in particular. It is shown that centering is most conveniently seen as a projection step, where the data are projected onto certain well-defined spaces within a given mode. This view of centering helps to explain why, for example, centering data with missing elements is likely to be suboptimal if there are many missing elements. Building a model for data consists of two parts: postulating a structural model and using a method to estimate the parameters. Centering has to do with the first part: when centering, a model including offsets is postulated. Scaling has to do with the second part: when scaling, another way of fitting the model is employed. It is shown that centering is simply a convenient technique to estimate model parameters for models with certain offsets, but this does not work for all types of offsets. It is also shown that scaling is a way to fit models with a weighted least squares loss function and that sometimes this change in objective function cannot be performed by a simple scaling step. Further practical aspects of and alternatives to centering and scaling are discussed, and examples are used throughout to show that the conclusions in the paper are not only of theoretical interest but can have an impact on practical data analysis.

	abstract = {High-resolution fluorescence spectroscopy was used to characterize dissolved organic matter (DOM) in concentrated and unconcentrated water samples from a wide variety of freshwater, coastal and marine environments. Several types of fluorescent signals were observed, including humic-like, tyrosine-like, and tryptophan-like. Humic-like fluorescence consisted of two peaks, one stimulated by UV excitation (peak A) and one by visible excitation (peak C). For all samples, the positions of both excitation and emission maxima for peak C were dependent upon wavelength of observation, with a shift towards longer wavelength emission maximum at longer excitation wavelength and longer wavelength excitation maximum at longer emission wavelength. A trend was observed in the position of wavelength-independent maximum fluorescence (ExmaxEmmax) for peak C, with maximum at shorter excitation and emission wavelengths for marine samples than for freshwater samples. Mean positions of these maxima were: rivers ExmaxEmmax = 340448 nm; coastal water ExmaxEmmax = 342442 nm; marine shallow transitional ExmaxEmmax = 310423 nm; marine shallow eutrophic ExmaxEmmax = 299389 nm; and marine deep ExmaxEmmax = 340438 nm. Differences suggest that the humic material in marine surface waters is chemically different from humic material in the other environments sampled. These results explain previous conflicting reports regarding fluorescence properties of DOM from natural waters and also provide a means of distinguishing between water mass sources in the ocean.},

	abstract = {THE natural fluorescence properties of sea water provide a means of elucidating the complex chemical composition and diverse sources of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in sea water1–6. The positions of excitation and emission maxima for a wide range of natural water samples show remarkable similarity7. High-sensitivity fluorescence spectroscopic studies8 have shown recently that emission maxima for marine and coastal waters differ by 20 nm when the excitation wavelength is 313 nm. Here we present evidence from three-dimensional excitation emission matrix (EEM) spectroscopy that at least three fluorophores are present in waters of the Black Sea. Distinct changes in the relative abundance of these fluorophores are observed as a function of depth. We suggest that three-dimensional fluorescence spectroscopy can be used to distinguish between different types and sources of DOM in natural waters. These findings may have important applications in the field of remote sensing of phytoplankton pigments. For example, a better understanding of the sources of DOM components will help in correcting9,10 remotely sensed data for the presence of gelbstoff (yellow-coloured DOM11, which plays an important part in radiation absorption by surface waters).},

These include the most relevant instrument properties needing qualification, such as linearity and spectral responsivity of the detection system, spectral irradiance reaching the sample, wavelength accuracy, sensitivity or limit of detection for an analyte, and day-to-day performance verification. With proper consideration of method-inherent requirements and limitations, many of these procedures and standards can be adapted to other fluorescence techniques. In addition, procedures for the determination of other relevant fluorometric quantities including fluorescence quantum yields and fluorescence lifetimes are briefly introduced. The guide is a clear and concise reference geared for users of fluorescence instrumentation at all levels of experience and is intended to aid in the ongoing standardization of fluorescence measurements.},

However, the intrinsic presence of scattering effects in the EEM measurements poses a practical problem. Appropriate handling of the scatter is necessary to avoid detrimental influence on the models. The two most common methods of handling scatter are evaluated in this paper: replacing the scattering area with missing elements or with interpolated values. Both were assessed in terms of stability of the models and quality of predictions. The methods were compared using four different datasets showing diverse scattering effects that was also partly overlapping key chemical areas. The results suggested that the use of missing values lead to more problems related to local minima, which also considerably increases the time of analysis. Only the best fitting models obtained with missing values showed similar spectral recoveries and good predictions in comparison with those ones obtained with interpolated data. Furthermore, the use of missing values in the PARAFAC models hindered the correct decomposition of very complex samples, which showed to be more robust by means of using interpolated data.},

	abstract = {The biochemical composition of dissolved organic matter (DOM) strongly influences its biogeochemical role in freshwater ecosystems, yet DOM composition measurements are not routinely incorporated into ecological studies. To date, the majority of studies of freshwater ecosystems have relied on bulk analyses of dissolved organic carbon and nitrogen to obtain information about DOM cycling. The problem with this approach is that the biogeochemical significance of DOM can only partially be elucidated using bulk analyses alone because bulk measures cannot detect most carbon and nitrogen transformations. Advances in fluorescence spectroscopy provide an alternative to traditional approaches for characterizing aquatic DOM, and allow for the rapid and precise characterization of DOM necessary to more comprehensively trace DOM dynamics. It is within this context that we discuss the use of fluorescence spectroscopy to provide a novel approach to tackling a longstanding problem: understanding the dynamics and biogeochemical role of DOM. We highlight the utility of fluorescence characterization of DOM and provide examples of the potential range of applications for incorporating DOM fluorescence into ecological studies in the hope that this rapidly evolving technique will further our understanding of the biogeochemical role of DOM in freshwater ecosystems.},

The FE250 ratio of the ultrafiltered organic fractions increased with decreasing molecular size of the DOC. However, under field conditions this ratio failed to predict molecular size distribution. These results limit the applicability of E250 and F as measures of molecular size and concentration of DOC.

	abstract = {A new approach for parameterizing dissolved organic matter (DOM) ultraviolet-visible absorption spectra is presented. Two distinct spectral slope regions (275-295 nm and 350-400 nm) within log-transformed absorption spectra were used to compare DOM from contrasting water types, ranging from wetlands (Great Dismal Swamp and Suwannee River) to photobleached oceanic water (Atlantic Ocean). On the basis of DOM size-fractionation studies (ultrafiltration and gel filtration chromatography), the slope of the 275-295-nm region and the ratio of these slopes (SR; 275-295-nm slope : 350-400-nm slope) were related to DOM molecular weight (MW) and to photochemically induced shifts in MW. Dark aerobic microbial alteration of chromophoric DOM (CDOM) resulted in spectral slope changes opposite of those caused by photochemistry. Along an axial transect in the Delaware Estuary, large variations in SR were measured, probably due to mixing, photodegradation, and microbial alteration of CDOM as terrestrially derived DOM transited through the estuary. Further, SR varied by over a factor of 13 between DOM-rich wetland waters and Sargasso Sea surface waters. Currently, there is no consensus on a wavelength range for log-transformed absorption spectra. We propose that the 275-295-nm slope be routinely reported in future DOM studies, as it can be measured with high precision, it facilitates comparison among dissimilar water types including CDOM-rich wetland and CDOM-poor marine waters, and it appears to be a good proxy for DOM MW.},

	abstract = {The isolation, characterization and study of the properties of aquatic dissolved organic matter (DOM) still represent a challenge because of the heterogeneity, complexity and low concentration of organic material in natural waters. Based on its ability to interact with contaminants and thus to modify their transport and bioavailability, DOM is of interest for environmental purposes. The objective of this work was to better characterize DOM in the Gironde Estuary (southwestern France). The estuary represents an exchange zone between the continent and the Atlantic Ocean and conditions the transfer of organic and inorganic substances from the continental to the oceanic environment. Several samples were collected along the estuary during three cruises in 2002 and 2006. They were analysed using excitation–emission matrix (EEM) spectroscopy, a sensitive technique that allows direct analysis of water samples. Fluorescent DOM and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) did not behave conservatively in this estuarine system, i.e. the organic material did not undergo simple dilution from the upstream to the downstream part of the estuary. A seasonal variability in DOC content was pointed out, whereas few seasonal variations in DOM fluorescence were observed. DOM sources and processing in the estuary were further evaluated by determining two fluorescence indices – the humification index (HIX) and the index of recent autochthonous contribution (BIX). By applying these indices, the relative degree of humification (HIX) and autotrophic productivity (BIX) could be assessed. Based on the fluorescence and DOC results, the estuary was divided into three zones depending on salinity (S) and characterized by specific DOM: (i) A turbid zone of low salinity (S{\textless}5) and high suspended particulate matter concentration with increase in the intensities of the α′ and α fluorophores, characteristic of humic-like compounds. (ii) A mid-estuarine zone (5{\textless}S{\textless}25) characterized by low autotrophic productivity and containing strongly degraded organic material, as shown by the low values of BIX and high values of HIX. (iii) A higher salinity area (S{\textgreater}25) characterized by increased autotrophic productivity and a marked marine influence, and associated with high and low values of BIX and HIX, respectively. The HIX and BIX indices were shown as useful tools for readily defining and classifying DOM characteristics in estuarine waters.},

	abstract = {The fluorescence of dissolved organic matter (DOM) is suppressed by a phenomenon of self-quenching known as the inner filter effect (IFE). Despite widespread use of fluorescence to characterize DOM in surface waters, the advantages and constraints of IFE correction are poorly defined. We assessed the effectiveness of a commonly used absorbance-based approach (ABA), and a recently proposed controlled dilution approach (CDA) to correct for IFE. Linearity between corrected fluorescence and total absorbance (ATotal; the sum of absorbance at excitation and emission wavelengths) across the full excitation-emission matrix (EEM) in dilution series of four samples indicated both ABA and CDA were effective to an absorbance of at least 1.5 in a 1 cm cell, regardless of wavelength positioning. In regions of the EEMs where signal to background noise (S/N) was low, CDA correction resulted in more variability than ABA correction. From the ABA algorithm, the onset of significant IFE ({\textgreater}5\%) occurs when absorbance exceeds 0.042. In these cases, IFE correction is required, which was the case for the vast majority (97\%) of lakes in a nationwide survey (n= 554). For highly absorbing samples, undesirably large dilution factors would be necessary to reduce absorbance below 0.042. For rare EEMs with ATotal {\textgreater} 1.5 (3.0\% of the lakes in the Swedish survey), a 2-fold dilution is recommended followed by ABA or CDA correction. This study shows that for the vast majority of natural DOM samples the most commonly applied ABA algorithm provides adequate correction without prior dilution.},

In this review, we comprehensively compared the UV-Vis spectroscopy–based DOM parameters widely used for the last few decades, aiming to broaden our knowledge about the utilization of the spectra for DOM studies through bridging the gaps between different research areas (e.g., natural versus engineered systems). The parameters for chromophoric DOM (CDOM) addressed here encompass absorption coefficient, absorption ratios, spectral slopes, derivative and differential spectra, Gaussian decomposition, and two-dimensional correlation analysis. The benefit of using such parameters could be maximized in complementary uses both for static environments and dynamic processes. For the fullest utilization of the spectral potential, it is recommended to open the raw UV-Vis spectra and the measurement conditions (solution chemistry, types of water, wavelengths, derivation methods, etc) to the public, which can enhance global comparison and our understanding of the fate and the distribution of CDOM and the dynamics in various aquatic environments.},

Microbially derived fulvic acids have fluorophores with a more sharply defined emission peak occurring at lower wavelengths than fluorophores in terrestrially derived fulvic acids. We show that the ratio of the emission intensity at a wavelength of 450 nm to that at 500 nm, obtained with an excitation of 370 nm, can serve as a simple index to distinguish sources of isolated aquatic fulvic acids. In our study, this index has a value of 1.9 for microbially derived fulvic acids and a value of 1.4 for terrestrially derived fulvic acids. Fulvic acids isolated from four large rivers in the United States have fluorescence index values of 1.4–1.5, consistent with predominantly terrestrial sources. For fulvic acid samples isolated from a river, lakes, and groundwaters in a forested watershed, the fluorescence index varied in a manner suggesting different sources for the seepage and streamfed lakes. Furthermore, we identified these distinctive fluorophores in filtered whole water samples from lakes in a desert oasis in Antarctica and in filtered whole water samples collected during snowmelt from a Rocky Mountain stream. The fluorescence index measurement in filtered whole water samples in field studies may augment the interpretation of dissolved organic carbon sources for understanding carbon cycling in aquatic ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Previous work has shown that the photo-oxidation rate of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) exposed to solar radiation was significantly enhanced in acidic stream waters and that the average photo-oxidative loss of DOC in the UVA region was more than 60\%. This study examined the effect of pH on photobleaching and the photo-oxidative loss of DOC and the degree of photo-oxidative loss by hydroxyl radicals (•OH) over the pH range 4–9 in a coloured, softwater stream. Binding iron with NaF lowered the photo-oxidation rate constant by about 50\% at pH 4 and by 10–20\% at pH 4.6 and 4.9. Hence, iron plays an important role in the photo-oxidative loss of DOC at pH 4 with declining importance as the pH increases. The importance of •OH in photo-oxidative loss of stream DOC was evaluated by adding KI to quench •OH. After 69 hours of artificial irradiation without KI, DOC loss decreased as pH increased from pH 4 to 9 whereas the minimum loss of absorbance at 300 nm occurred at pH 7. KI significantly reduced loss of DOC at pH 4, 5 and 7 but not at pH 9 with the fraction of DOC lost by non-•OH mechanisms gradually increasing from 58\% to 75\% between pH 4 and 7, and 100\% at pH 9. Since many northern freshwater lakes on the Precambrian Shield receive large fluxes of UV-labile humic matter from peatlands and have pH {\textless} 7.5, photo-oxidative loss of DOC by both non-•OH and •OH mechanisms is important in C dynamics in northern freshwaters but with photo-oxidative loss dominated by non-•OH mechanisms likely operating in the UVA region.},

	abstract = {The use of fluorescence spectrometry has been suggested as a simple method to determine the extent of natural organic matter humification by quantifying the red-shifting of fluorescence emission that occurs with increasing humification. Humification indices are calculated by dividing fluorescence intensity at longer wavelengths by intensity at shorter wavelengths. These indices calculated without any specific efforts to standardize dissolved organic matter (DOM) concentration will result in index values that vary with DOM concentration due to fluorescence inner-filtering effects. This study critically evaluated the effect of DOM concentration on humification index determination using organic matter isolated from field corn extract, soil:water extract, and soil fulvic acid. The results show that humification index values are sensitive to DOM concentration of the solution and are linear with respect to transmittance of the solution at the 254 nm used as the excitation wavelength. An approximate correction for DOM is to exploit the linear nature of the regression fit and to determine index values at the extrapolated 100\% transmittance value. An exact correction using explicit correction factors for both primary and secondary inner-filtration effects was shown to give humification index values that are concentration invariant when absorbance of the solution at 254 nm was less than approximately 0.3 unit. Defining the humification index as the fluorescence intensity in the 300→345 nm region divided by the sum of intensity in the 300→345 nm and 435→480 nm regions was statistically advantageous. This study suggests that for quantitative results which can be used to compare humification of natural organic matter across different studies, correction of the fluorescence emission spectra for inner-filtration effects is needed.},

	abstract = {Fluorescence-based observations provide useful, sensitive information concerning the nature and distribution of colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in coastal and freshwater environments. The excitation–emission matrix (EEM) technique has become widely used for evaluating sources and sinks of CDOM. Water scattering peaks, however, can create problems for quantitative analysis and display of the EEMs, especially for samples with low CDOM concentrations. Here we report a new method for eliminating Rayleigh and Raman scatter peaks from EEMs during post-processing of the data in MATLAB®. An algorithm was developed to excise scatter peaks (i.e. peak emission±10–15 nm at each excitation wavelength) from the scan data and replace the excised values using three-dimensional interpolation of the remaining data (Delaunay triangulation method). The interpolated surface was constrained to pass through the non-excised values so that only data in excised portions were replaced. Tests of the algorithm in non-scatter regions indicate expected deviations of 0–4\% for interpolated regions of DOM fluorescence peaks (i.e. difference between measured and interpolated intensity after removal/interpolation), which is within machine error for the primary observations. This new scattering correction method is shown to provide much improved results in the quantitative analysis of EEMs compared to the conventional blank-subtraction procedure. The method is used to process EEMs and fluorescence quantum yields for water samples obtained along a salinity transect in a river located on the coast of the southeastern United States. Results of this analysis demonstrate observed shifts in EEM peak positions along most of the transect cannot be accounted for by a simple model that computes EEMs as a function of salinity assuming that the dominant driver of EEM spectral change is mixing between riverine and marine waters within the estuary. Other results show that fluorescence apparent quantum yields (AQYs) increased with increasing salinity and pH in the estuary and that the highest quantum yields are observed on excitation by 350–380-nm light. Modeling results and the observed EEM spectral changes indicate that photoreactions had an important effect on the fluorescent dissolved organic matter (FDOM) optical properties in the estuary. The increase in fluorescence quantum yields with increasing salinity and pH in the estuary likely were caused by reactions involving magnesium or hydroxide ions that reduced fluorescence quenching by chelated iron and possibly other paramagnetic ions. The results of the study indicate that EEM analysis with careful scatter correction can provide a powerful tool for evaluating pathways for carbon cycling in estuaries.},

The spectral slope (S) describing the approximate exponential decline in CDOM absorption with increasing wavelength is widely used for tracing changes in the chemical composition of CDOM. The currently accepted method of characterizing CDOM absorption (i.e., fitting a simple exponential model) can lead to loss of information and large errors. We propose a better method for modeling CDOM absorption spectra based on a Gaussian decomposition approach that removes the errors associated with the choice of the spectral range used to estimate S. Using artificially generated spectra with known parameters (n=1000), we show that our method provides robust estimates of S closely resembling the original values. On average, the error on S estimations was 0.16\% for the proposed method compared to 27\% and 11\% for the traditional modeling approaches fitted over 300–700nm and 240–700nm respectively. We further demonstrate the ability of the method to decompose and model chromophores present in complex spectra from oceanic water samples from around the world. The proposed method opens avenues for long-term or cross-site comparison studies of the dynamics of the CDOM pool and constitutes a promising supplement to techniques based on CDOM fluorescence.},

While methods for sample processing and PARAFAC analysis are well defined and robust, subsequent classification of DOM fluorescence components and comparisons of components among studies remain highly qualitative. Because these comparisons often guide the interpretation of subsequent data, it is important that quantitatively accurate comparisons be made. We developed a statistical tool, comPARAFAC, using a modified Tucker's Congruence Coefficient (mTCC), an established method of factor comparison, to provide a quantitative basis for comparing models. To develop and test this tool we used mTCC to compare factors from 35 DOM fluorescence studies using Parallel Factor Analysis (PARAFAC) in marine and freshwater environments. We compared mTCC-guided component matching with qualitative comparisons made in the literature to describe the current perceptions of component equivalence. Based on our analysis, 21\% of the direct comparisons made using the qualitative approach are potentially erroneous, whereas possible matches are missed 14\% of the time using that same approach. The procedure and accompanying PARAFAC model library for performing quantitative mTCC-guided comparisons are available as an R package (see Web Appendix A).

	abstract = {A single exponential model of the form ag(λ)∝e−seλ was evaluated in the context of its application and interpretation in describing absorption by chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM), ag, as a function of wavelength, λ. The spectral slope, se, is often used as a proxy for CDOM composition, including the ratio of fulvic to humic acids and molecular weight. About three-quarters of the variability in se values from the literature could be explained by the different spectral ranges used in each study. Dependency on different spectral ranges resulted from the relatively weak performance of the single exponential as a descriptor of ag(λ) in comparison to other models that allow for greater spectral curvature. Consequently, actual variability in the spectral shape of absorption, and thus the composition of CDOM, from widely varying water types appears less than currently thought. The usefulness of five other models in describing CDOM absorption spectra in the visible domain was also evaluated. Six data sets collected with an ac9 in-situ spectrophotometer from around the coastal United States were used in the analysis. All models considered performed better than the conventional single exponential model, with the exception of a double exponential model, where the second exponential term contributed little new information in the fit. Statistically, the most “useful” model (judged by an analysis of variance) in the visible range was a hyperbolic model of the form: ag(λ)∝λ−sh. Although the hyperbolic model was less dependent on the spectral range used in the fit, some dependency remained. The most representative model for describing ag(λ) from the six regions considered in this study, with ag at 412 nm as input, was: ag(λ)=ag(412)(λ/412)−6.92. This spectral relationship may be suitable for remote sensing semi-analytical models which must compute a spectrum from a single estimate of CDOM absorption in the blue derived from a remotely sensed water-leaving radiance signal.},

	abstract = {The roles of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in microbial processes and nutrient cycles depend on its composition, which requires detailed measurements and analyses. We introduce a package for R, called staRdom (\&ldquo;spectroscopic analysis of DOM in R\&rdquo;), to analyze DOM spectroscopic data (absorbance and fluorescence), which is key to deliver fast insight into DOM composition of many samples. staRdom provides functions that standardize data preparation and analysis of spectroscopic data and are inspired by practical work. The user can perform blank subtraction, dilution correction, Raman normalization, scatter removal and interpolation, and fluorescence normalization. The software performs parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) of excitation\&ndash;emission matrices (EEMs), including peak picking of EEMs, and calculates fluorescence indices, absorbance indices, and absorbance slope indices from EEMs and absorbance spectra. A comparison between PARAFAC solutions by staRdom in R compared with drEEM in MATLAB showed nearly identical solutions for most datasets, although different convergence criteria are needed to obtain similar results and interpolation of missing data is important when working with staRdom. In conclusion, staRdom offers the opportunity for standardized multivariate decomposition of spectroscopic data without requiring software licensing fees and presuming only basic R knowledge.},
