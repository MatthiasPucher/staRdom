\value{
A data frame containing the adsorption slopes and slope ratios in column, one line for each sample.
}
\description{
Calculating slopes and slope ratios of a data frame of absorbance data.
}
\details{
The absorbance data is a data frame with the first column called "wavelength" containg the wavelength. Each other column contains the data from one sample. You can use \link{absorbance_read} to read in appropriate data.

The following spectral parameters are calculated:
\itemize{
   \item $S_{275-295}$ slope between 275 and 295 nm calculated with nonlinear regression
   \item $S_{350-400}$ slope between 350 and 400 nm calculated with nonlinear regression
   \item $S_{300-700}$ slope between 275 and 295 nm calculated with nonlinear regression
   \item SR slope ratio, calculated by $S_{275-295}$/$S_{350-400}$
   \item E2:E3 ratio $a_{250}$/$a_{365}$
   \item E4:E6 ratio $a_{465}$/$a_{665}$
   \item $a_{254}$ absorbance at 254 nm
   \item $a_{300}$ absorbance at 300 nm
   }
Depending on available wavelength range, values might be NA.
Additionally other wavelength limits can be defined. The slope ratio might fail in this case.
For further details please refer to Helm et al. (2008).
